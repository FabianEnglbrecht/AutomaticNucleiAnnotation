The folder "Code" is containing following files/folders:
- python-file: "1_otsu_binary_threshold.py"
- python-file: "2_generate_black_pixel_background.py"
- python-file: "3_nuclei_filter_and_label.py"
- python-file: "4_add_random_noise"
- data-folder: "Frames"
- data-folder: "Otsu"
- data-folder: "Background"
- data-folder: "Masks"
- data-folder: "Output_blurred"

The python-files have to be executed in order "1_..."-"4_..." for providing automatically annotated training data.
The data-folder "Frames" has to be filled with raw image data. 
All images files have to be renamed regarding the convention stated in the python files (e.g. "frame1", "frame2", ...)
Data-folders "Masks" "Output_blurred" contain training masks and images used for training a neural network (e.g. U-Net)
